            Hi! I'm Shivani Vora, and I'm a first year Computer Science major from New Hampshire. 
            I have no experience with web development so this is entirely new to me and I'm really excited to get started!

            Previously, I have worked with a non-profit company to create an educational book on Machine Learning using python. 
            They work to make computer science education accessible and I helped them by co-creating and editing the official manuscript that was eventually published into a book.

            A couple of things about me: I love pretty much any sit-com, I like to read murder mysteries, and I really like dinosaurs!
