            Hi y'all! I'm Leila. I'm a 3rd year CS major from ATL. My threads are people and media.

                &#128151 I love to rollerskate at the skate park. I used to be really scared of anything dangerous but this is my way to take more risks. 
                <br> &#128151 I'm very passionate about cooking! I make really elaborate meals from scratch and waste a lot of time that way sometimes.
                <br> &#128151 Recently I've gotten really into ancient history and I'm wondering if I should have been a classics major. 
                <br> &#128151 I went to the Chattanooga aquarium with my girlfriend and now I love macaroni penguins. See below.
