        What's up y'all, my name is Taylor and I'm a third year CS major 
        here at Tech. Looking forward to getting to know everyone in bootcamp this semester :)

      <p class="bog">
        My main service experience is my time volunteering with AmeriCorps NCCC, 
        a national service program like the Peace Corps but in the US and for shorter assignments. 
        After spending a month in Sacramento, California, my team was sent off for three months in 
        San Rafael, California helping with the city fire department's wildfire mitigation efforts. The 
        next six months we aided the county health department's vaccine distribution in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was a huge growing 
        experience and incredibly rewarding making an impact in communities that needed help.
