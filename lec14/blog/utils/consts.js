    title: "The BoG Blog",
    content: `Welcome to the Launch of BoG Blog!

        As Bits of Good has grown over the years, our members have learned so much about social good, our technical work, and about Georgia Tech and Atlanta as a whole. We want to create a digital space where all of this knowledge can be collected and shared.
        
        2020 Posting Schedule:
        
        2 Articles a Week, Every Week
        Technical Tuesdays: Bits of Good has talented members with technical skills in a multitude of fields. Tuesday articles will highlight interesting facets of these areas across all fields from Engineering to Ops, from Product to Design. Check in to learn more about the work your fellow BoG members are doing!
        Fun Fridays: Friday articles can cover anything from Social Good focused opinion pieces to profiles on exceptional BoG members to slice-of-life summaries of life at Georgia Tech and Atlanta.
        If you have another area that you would like BoG Blog to cover or want to participate as a writer in BoG Blog, please reach out to Sneha Kadiyala on Slack!

    title: "The Design Bootcamp Experience",
    content: `Last semester, Bits of Good ran Design Bootcamp 1.0, our first rendition of an intensive beginner crash course to teach design concepts and methodologies. This twin flame to our developer bootcamp was meant to introduce Georgia Tech students to the design practices that our product designers implement on BoG project teams. Huan and Jason, both former Directors of Design for Bits of Good, led the inaugural group of designers through the process from initial product and user research through final product designs and presentations.

        The process was fast-paced but thorough. To get a more student-oriented depiction of the Design experience, we asked a few members of the bootcamp to talk about the process and what they’ve learned from it. Divita Chillakuru, one of the participants, said the following:
        
        “As we’re almost half of the way through the design bootcamp, it’s been lovely to see how far we’ve gotten within this relatively short timespan. We’ve been submitting a Weekly UI assignment, which is a fun way to ensure we keep practicing regularly. I love being able to scroll back and clearly see how our designs have been improving week by week, along with the adorable camaraderie being built through the peer critiques. The ongoing case study that we work on for the entirety of the bootcamp prepares us for the UX side of things as we learn more about designing for a specific user group. I enjoy how Jason and Huan balance their workshops by teaching us the techniques of using the software with the user research end of it.”
        
        As she described, the structure of the bootcamp was divided into weekly sessions that required hands-on design work from students. They also worked in groups to work on their capstone projects which funneled the design experience they gained over the course of the semester into one final exhibition. As Karis Wang, another bootcamp member, enjoyed her group experience saying:
        
        “After being at Design Bootcamp, I can say I feel much more confident in my design and research skills. The past fun and insightful weeks with my fellow bootcampers have made me a more curious designer and challenged me to explore designs outside my comfort zone. Right now, Joyce and I are doing a case study about redesigning the MARTA experience to help Atlanta riders. I’m super excited to see how everything turns out by the end of the semester!”
        
        While bootcampers worked in groups of 2–3 on their individual capstone projects, the group feedback sessions included the entire cohort as well as Huan and Jason, building a community of designers learning together even if it was all through zoom. Singer Cheng touches on the community aspect emphasizing:
        
        “I’ve been really enjoying being a part of the design bootcamp this semester as not only do I get the opportunity to improve upon my design skills with the weekly workshops, but I have also met so many super talented and cool people through this!! I love getting to see what everyone creates and being able to constantly give & receive feedback from each other, which is such a valuable experience as a designer. I would say that especially with everything being virtual this semester, it can become pretty difficult to feel connected and meet new people, but joining the bootcamp has definitely made me feel like i’m a part of a community :,) I’m grateful to have met individuals who are just as passionate about design and who continue to inspire me every day!!”
        
        If you’re interested in learning about design but have no previous experience, consider applying to the Design bootcamp and getting an awesome, directed crash course through Design!`,

    title: "Looking Back at our First Semester",
    content: `We first started planning for the Bits of Good Blog at the beginning of the year. As Bits of Good grew to 200+ members, we wanted an online forum where members could share their knowledge and experiences about Georgia Tech, social good, and technical skills with a wider audience. We’ve officially successfully completed our first semester with an active BoG BloG with 12 Bits of Good members joining us as writers, 20+ articles published and 2100+ views.

    This is only the beginning. In the future, we want to hear from more voices within Bits of Good on different topics. We had one technical piece this semester, but imagine a future with series of technical writers exploring new technology and educating current and future Bits of Good members about it to strengthen project teams. Our designers have published amazing pieces about accessibility and work processes within design, but there’s so much more to explore about brand creation, product design, and the role of design in our world / on project-teams. Internship hunting is also a large part of life at Georgia Tech and directed articles that could not only help current members but future GT students for years to come should hold a cornerstone of the Bits of Good Blog. In terms of Bits of Good, we want to hear more from you.
    
    What was your experience growing through Bits of Good?
    
    Do you have an interesting story you want to share with others or practical tips on how to navigate Georgia Tech?
    
    If you have an interest in telling these stories, either writing them under the guidance of our editors or working with a content writer so they can write the piece, please reach out to us through this google form.
    
    Thank you to everyone who made this possible. Coordinating multiple writers and maintaining a consistent upload required a tremendous effort form our marketing committee and our content writers and the graciousness of every BoG member who volunteered to add to the blog.
    
    Congratulations on a successful Demo Day, a successful semester for the BoG Blog, and good luck on finals!
